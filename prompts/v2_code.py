# Suppose you have a GIS shapefile of census tracts and a raster of flood
# depths. The shapefile is named `svi.shp` and contains vector polygons
# withg corresponding data fields. One field is named `RPL_THEMES` and
# measures the social vulnerability index (SVI). The raster file is named
# `raster.tif` and contains flood depths in meters. Each pixel in the
# raster file corresponds to a small region of the map, but there is no
# direct correspondence between the raster data and the vector data.
# Assume the raster and vector data are in the same coordinate system. You
# may need to crop the raster data to the relevant polygons in the
# shapefile. You may also need to extract statistics from the raster for
# each polygon.

# Write a function that will answer GIS queries. The code can make use
# of the `rasterio`, `fiona`, `pandas` and `numpy` libraries. The
# `fiona` library can be used to manipulate shapefiles. The `rasterio`
# library can be used to manipulate raster files. The `rasterio.mask`
# module can be used to mask raster data with vector data. The `pandas`
# library can be used to create and manipulate dataframes. The `numpy`
# library can perform operations on multidimensional arrays. You do not
# need to provide any explanation of the code, or comments in the code.
# Simply provide the code needed to answer the query.
