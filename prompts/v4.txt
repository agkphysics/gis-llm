Suppose you have a GIS shapefile of census tracts and a raster of flood depths. The shapefile is named `svi.shp` and contains vector polygons withg corresponding data fields. One field is named `RPL_THEMES` and measures the social vulnerability index (SVI). The raster file is named `raster.tif` and contains flood depths in meters. Each pixel in the raster file corresponds to a small region of the map, but there is no direct correspondence between the raster data and the vector data. Assume the raster and vector data are in the same coordinate system. You may need to crop the raster data to the relevant polygons in the shapefile. You may also need to extract statistics from the raster for each polygon.

Generate Python code that will answer GIS queries. The code can make use of the `rasterio`, `fiona`, `pandas`, `geopandas` and `numpy` libraries. The `fiona` library can be used to manipulate shapefiles. The `rasterio` library can be used to manipulate raster files. The `rasterio.mask` module can be used to mask raster data with vector data. The `pandas` library can be used to create and manipulate dataframes. The `geopandas` library can be used to manipulate shapefiles as `pandas` dataframes. The `numpy` library can perform operations on multidimensional arrays. Do not provide an explanation of the code, or comments in the code. Simply provide the code needed to answer the query.
