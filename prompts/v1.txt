Suppose you have a GIS shapefile of census tracts and a raster of flood depths. The shapefile is named `svi.shp` and contains various fields. One field is named `RPL_THEMES` and measures the social vulnerability index (SVI). The raster file is named `raster.tif` and contains flood depths in meters. Assume the files are in the same coordinate system. The shapefile is a vector format, so you may need to crop the raster to the relevant polygons in the shapefile. You may also want to extract statistics from the raster for each polygon.

Generate Python code that will answer GIS queries. The code can make use of the `rasterio`, `fiona` and `pandas` libraries. The `fiona` library can be used to manipulate shapefiles. The `rasterio` library can be used to manipulate raster files. The `rasterio.mask` module can be used to mask raster data with vector data. The `pandas` library can be used to create and manipulate dataframes.
