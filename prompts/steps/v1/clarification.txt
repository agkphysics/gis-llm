## Step 1 (query clarification)
User query: {query}

Ask questions of the user until the query meets the following criteria, then rewrite the query based on the user's responses.

Here are the criteria of a good query:
- Contains the geographic area(s) of interest (e.g. country, state, city, suburb)
- Contains the geographical factor(s) of interest (e.g. flooding, elevation, soil type)
- Contains any sociopolitical factor(s) of interest (e.g. poverty, healthcare)
- Does not need to contain specific data sources.

If you want to ask a follow-up question, your answer should be formatted as follows:
```json
{
    "followup": "{question}"
}
```
Replace {question} with your follow-up question.

If you believe the query is specific enough, your answer should be formatted as follows:
```json
{
    "result": "Specific enough",
    "query": "{revised_query}"
}
```
Replace {revised_query} with the revised query.
