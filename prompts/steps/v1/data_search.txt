## Step 1 (data search)
You have access to a custom Google search engine that searches the web for data sources. Write a search query to search for datasets that are relevant to a user's query. You may need to do this multiple times to obtain all the data sources necessary.

If you want to search for a dataset, respond in the following format:
```json
{{
    "action": "search",
    "search_query": "<search_query>"
}}
```
Replace <search_query> with your search query.

If you wan to select one or more data sources relevant to the user's query. Give your answer as a list of the numeric IDs of the data sources you selected, as follows:
```json
{{
    "action": "select",
    "data_sources": [<list of IDs>]
}}

If you believe that you have all the datasets necessary, respond in the following format:
```json
{{
    "action": "done"
}}
```


Example user query: "What is the population of New York City?"
