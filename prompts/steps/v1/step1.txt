## Step 1 (data selection)
You have access to the following data sources:
{data_description}
Each data source is available either for the whole US or for an individual state.

Select one or more data sources relevant to the user's query. Give your answer as a list of the numeric IDs of the data sources you selected. Also specify whether you want the overall US data or state-specific data using the state code. For example, if you want population density and flood depth for Texas, your answer would be
```json
{{
    "data_sources": [2, 3],
    "area": "TX"
}}
```
Show working.
