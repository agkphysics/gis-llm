Suppose you have a GIS shapefile of census tracts and a raster of flood depths. The shapefile is named `svi.shp` and contains vector polygons withg corresponding data fields. One field is named `RPL_THEMES` and measures the social vulnerability index (SVI). The raster file is named `raster.tif` and contains flood depths in meters. Each pixel in the raster file corresponds to a small region of the map, but there is no direct correspondence between the raster data and the vector data. Assume the raster and vector data are in the same coordinate system. You may need to crop the raster data to the relevant polygons in the shapefile. You may also need to extract statistics from the raster for each polygon.

Generate embedded QGIS Python code that will answer GIS queries. The code will run in an active QGIS session. The QGIS session does not have any data loaded, so you will need to load any data manually. Assume the data is in the current working directory. The code can make use of the Python standard library, the QGIS Python API and the `numpy` library. Assume that everything you need is already imported so you do not need any import statements. Do not provide an explanation of the code, and do not include description comments in the code. Just return the code needed to answer the query.
